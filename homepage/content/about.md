# Hello :)

I am a french computer scientist

this little website is here to talk about my interests, my projects and store some bookmarks


# What am I working on right now ?

## sound visualizer
A project that creates and display scrolling spectrograms for youtube and soundcloud.

It was originally a pretext to learn DSP and front-end programming.
It lead me to learn machine learning, so I could do some advanced stuff, like track splitting.

You can try it [here](https://sound-visualizer.projects.luc-leonard.fr/)
